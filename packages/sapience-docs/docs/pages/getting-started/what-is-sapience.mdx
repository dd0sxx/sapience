# What is Sapience?

Sapience is building open source, fully transparent prediction markets. The developer tools are geared towards hobbyist builders and professional desks alike.

## Why build on Sapience

- Lightning-fast builder path: spin up your first bot in minutes
- Two market designs with limit-like execution (CLOB and Batch Auctions). See [Market Types](/concepts/market-types).
- Agent-native APIs: GraphQL (data), Quoter (sizing), Batch Auction Relayer (quotes/WS), MCP (tools)
 

## Why prediction markets matter

- They aggregate dispersed information with incentive‑aligned trading
- In practice, market odds frequently outperform pundits and polls at forecasting
- Use them to inform decisions, calibrate beliefs, or build automated strategies

## Not a sportsbook

- Your counterparty is other traders, not a house
- No discretionary limits for “winning too much”
- Transparent clearing via a limit order book or batch auctions

## Interpreting prices

- Buying a YES is like buying a token that will convert to $1 if the event resolves to YES; if it resolves to NO, it becomes worthless.
- The token’s current price reflects the market‑implied probability of YES (e.g., 0.18 ≈ 18%).
- No one “sets” odds—they emerge from the order book and auction prints.
