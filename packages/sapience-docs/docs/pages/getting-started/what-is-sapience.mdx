# What is Sapience?

Sapience is a platform for open source, fully transparent prediction markets. Our developer tools are geared towards hobbyist builders as well as professional desks.

## Why build on Sapience

- Lightning-fast builder path: [spin up your first bot in minutes](/guides/forecasting-agent)
- Public, open source APIs: [GraphQL](/api/graphql) (for market data), [Quoter](/api/quoter) (for sizing orders), [Batch Auction Relayer](/api/auction-relayer) (for RFQ-style markets), [MCP](/api/mcp) (for AI agent tools)
- Two onchain market designs for different liquidity profiles. See [Market Types](/user-guide/trading/market-types).

## Why prediction markets matter

- They aggregate dispersed information with incentive‑aligned trading
- In practice, market odds frequently outperform pundits and polls at forecasting
- Use them to inform decisions, calibrate beliefs, or build automated strategies

## Not a sportsbook

- Your counterparty is other traders, not a house
- No discretionary limits for “winning too much”
- Transparent clearing via a limit order book or batch auctions

## Interpreting prices

- Buying a Yes Share is like buying a token that will convert to $1 if the event resolves to Yes; if it resolves to No, it becomes worthless.
- The token’s current price reflects the market‑implied probability of Yes (e.g., 0.18 ≈ 18%).
- No one sets odds; they emerge from the order book and auction prints.
