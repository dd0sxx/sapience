This guide will walk you through setting up your development environment, creating necessary accounts, and configuring your AI-powered code editor to build with Sapience. You can then customize existing code or build your own project from scratch.

You can also just get right into the demo to deploy a forecasting agent and do the following steps as needed.

## Set up Git

If you don't already have a GitHub account, create one at [github.com](https://github.com/signup). Then, [download GitHub for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/).

GitHub is essential for:
- Version control of your code
- Collaborating with others
- Deploying your applications

## Set up Cursor

Cursor is a modern, AI-powered IDE with a free plan available. [**Download**](https://cursor.com)

Also consider using [Codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex), [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code), and [v0](https://v0.app/).

### Add Documentation

Allow your assistant to read these docs too.

1. Press `Cmd+K` (or open the palette) and type `@Docs`, or go to Settings → Features → Docs
2. Choose "Add doc"
3. Enter `https://docs.sapience.xyz/` as the URL
4. Name it "Sapience" and save to index
5. Use in prompts: `@Docs Sapience`

### Add Tools

Attaching the MCP server gives your editor tools that allow it to interact with Sapience's API directly. Learn more about the MCP server at [/builder-guide/api/mcp](/builder-guide/api/mcp).

1. Open Cursor → Settings → Cursor Settings → Tools & MCP → Add new MCP server
2. Paste the following configuration and save:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sapience": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://api.sapience.xyz/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Note this requires Node.js on your PATH so `npx` is available. (Ask an AI to help if you don't know what this means.)
- After saving, restart Cursor if tools do not appear.

## Create an Ethereum account for development

You'll need an Ethereum wallet to interact with Sapience markets. We recommend:

- **MetaMask**: [Download browser extension](https://metamask.io/download/)
- **Rainbow**: [Download mobile app](https://rainbow.me/)
- **Coinbase Wallet**: [Download](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)

For development and testing:
1. Create a new wallet
2. Save your seed phrase securely
3. Get test tokens from faucets for the networks you'll be testing on

:::warning
Never share your private keys or seed phrase. Use separate wallets for development and production.
:::

## Create an OpenRouter Account

OpenRouter provides access to multiple AI models for your applications.

1. Go to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Navigate to your API keys
4. Create a new API key for your project
5. Store the key securely in your environment variables

You can use OpenRouter to integrate AI capabilities into your Sapience-powered applications.
