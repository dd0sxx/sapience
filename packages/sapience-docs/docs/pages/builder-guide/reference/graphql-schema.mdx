# GraphQL Schema

> The latest version of this schema will be published in the `@sapience/sdk` npm package. You will be able to import it (and the generated TypeScript types) directly in your apps, and you can also copy the raw schema from GitHub.

Import examples (planned):

```ts
// Schema SDL (string)
import schema from '@sapience/sdk/graphql/schema.graphql'

// Generated TypeScript types for the schema
import type * as SapienceGraphQL from '@sapience/sdk/types/graphql'
```

Alternatively, copy the current `schema.graphql` from this repository at `packages/api/schema.graphql`.

Refer to the live GraphQL endpoint for the latest schema. Common types and queries are documented in API â†’ GraphQL.
