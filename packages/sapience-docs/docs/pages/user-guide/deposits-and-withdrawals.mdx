## Deposits & Withdrawals

Flow of USDe Collateral - Visualize USDe moving into Sapience, being used for trades/LP vaults, then exiting with principal + yield.

- **Collateral:** All markets use USDe, a reward-bearing stablecoin. This means balances earn yield automatically, even when idle.
- **Deposits:** Send USDe from your wallet into Sapience. It becomes available instantly for trading or liquidity provision.
- **Withdrawals:** Request funds back to your wallet. Once processed, you retain both your principal and any earned yield.
- **Transparency:** All deposits and withdrawals are recorded onchain, fully auditable by anyone.
