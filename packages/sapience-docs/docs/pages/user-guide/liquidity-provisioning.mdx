### Spot Market Liquidity

**Overview**

Liquidity providers (LPs) supply capital that makes markets tradable. By taking on some risk, LPs earn fees and yield. Without LPs, prediction markets would be thin and hard to trade.

**LP Models**

- **Auctions** – LPs allocate capital only when trades happen, minimizing idle exposure.
- **CLOB Promotion** – Markets with sustained volume can be upgraded to continuous order books, unlocking deeper liquidity.
- **Vaults** – Shared pools that automate liquidity provision. Example: the **Parlay LP Vault**, which earns returns by supplying liquidity across bundled markets. Over time, vault coverage can expand to individual markets.
