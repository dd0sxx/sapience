### Liquidity Provisioning

**Overview**

Liquidity providers (LPs) supply capital that makes markets tradable. By taking on some risk, LPs earn fees and yield. Without LPs, prediction markets would be thin and hard to trade.

**LP Models**

- **Batch Auctions** – LPs allocate capital only when trades happen, minimizing idle exposure.
- **CLOB Promotion** – Markets with sustained volume can be upgraded to continuous order books, unlocking deeper liquidity.
- **Vaults** – Shared pools that automate liquidity provision. Example: the **Parlay LP Vault**, which earns returns by supplying liquidity across bundled markets. Over time, vault coverage can expand to individual markets.

**LP Tutorial**

1. **Choose a vault or market** to support.
2. **Deposit USDe** into the pool.
3. **Provide liquidity** manually or via open-source bots.
4. **Earn yield** from fees and USDe’s native reward rate.
5. **Withdraw** after settlement or when you want to reallocate.
