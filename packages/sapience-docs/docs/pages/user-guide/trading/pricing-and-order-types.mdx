### Pricing & Order Types

Prices on Sapience reflect the **market-implied probability** of an outcome.

- If a Yes share trades at $0.25, the market is implying a 25% chance of Yes.
- **Batch Auctions** – Orders are collected over an interval and cleared together, which concentrates liquidity and reduces slippage.
- **RFQ (Request-for-Quote)** – Market makers provide quotes on demand, allowing efficient pricing across many outcomes.
- **Order Book (CLOB)** – For high-volume, longer-lived markets, Sapience can promote them to continuous order books with deep liquidity.

#### Order Types

- **Market Orders** – Buy or sell immediately at the best available price.
- **Conditional Orders / Parlays** – Combine multiple outcomes into one bundled trade. All must be correct for payout, enabling higher risk/reward profiles.
