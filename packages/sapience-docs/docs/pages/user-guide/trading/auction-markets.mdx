## Auction Markets

### Overview

Auctions power Sapience's primary system for conditional predictions. They enable you to combine multiple prediction outcomes into a single parlay and trade them through a short-lived RFQ-style matching process.

**Parlays** let you express multi-condition forecasts. Example: "Team A wins AND turnout ≥ 60%." If every condition resolves as predicted, the parlay wins; one incorrect leg loses the entire position.

- **Why parlays?** Higher potential payout for compound forecasts, simple win/lose outcome, and expressive predictions beyond a single market.
- **Probability intuition:** When outcomes are independent, the parlay's implied probability is the product of individual probabilities — hence lower combined probability and higher potential payoff.

### How Auctions Work

Auctions use an **RFQ (Request-for-Quote) model** with discrete clearing events:

1. Maker starts an auction by announcing their parlay (predicted outcomes + wager) to the relayer
2. Takers submit competing bids with their desired wager amounts and signed quotes
3. Maker selects the best bid (typically highest wager among non-expired quotes)
4. On-chain settlement mints the prediction NFTs for both maker and taker

Lifecycle: open → quote → cross → submit → settle

### Lifecycle at a Glance

1. **Creation** – A market question and rules are published onchain.
2. **Trading** – Participants build parlays and request quotes while the market is live.
3. **Resolution** – When the event concludes, the oracle determines the correct outcome.
4. **Settlement** – Winning parlays settle to $1 per share; losing parlays to $0.

### Conditions

Conditions are the fundamental building block for Auctions:

- **Definition:** A discrete statement to be resolved with a claim, end time, and resolution status
- **Composability:** Single conditions can be traded alone, or multiple conditions combined into parlays
- **Key fields:** `claimStatement`, `endTime`, category, status (open → closed → resolved)
- **Resolution:** Each condition is verified onchain via UMA's optimistic oracle

### Settlement & Resolution

After conditions close, resolution follows this flow:

1. An assertion with the proposed result is submitted with a bond
2. A liveness window allows disputes; disputes trigger UMA adjudication
3. If truthful (or undisputed), the result is accepted onchain
4. Parlays are evaluated: all conditions must match predictions for a win

### Data Access

- **WebSocket:** Real-time auction starts, bids, provisional crosses, and prints
- **GraphQL:** Indexed conditions, parlay positions, historical trades
- **API Reference:** [Auction Relayer](/builder-guide/reference/auction-relayer) for message schemas and validation

### Where Conditions Show Up

- **UI:** Parlay mode and auction lists display public conditions
- **API/GraphQL:** `conditions` queries; quotes and prints reference `conditionId`
- **Admin:** CSV import and CRUD for creating/editing conditions
