# Overview

## What are prediction markets?
- Brief explanation of how prediction markets work
- How they aggregate forecasts and reflect probabilities through pricing
- Real-world use cases (events, outcomes, forecasting)

## Why Sapience?

Sapience is community‑first with no fees collected by an exchange, fully [open source](https://github.com/sapiencexyz/sapience), and trustless by design—immutable smart contracts and decentralized settlement remove the need to trust an intermediary.

Under the hood, Sapience supports two complementary market types for different use cases. Auctions power multi‑condition predictions (parlays) with RFQ‑like matching, while spot markets enable continuous trading of single outcomes with efficient price discovery. All trading happens on [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io) using [Ethena](https://ethena.fi)'s reward‑bearing synthetic dollar USDe as collateral.

## Getting Started
- Connect an Ethereum wallet
- Have USDe (Ethena's synthetic dollar) for collateral
- ETH for gas fees on Arbitrum
- Link to [Deposits & Withdrawals](/user-guide/deposits-and-withdrawals)

## Market Lifecycle
- Markets are listed in the api/app
- Markets are settled
