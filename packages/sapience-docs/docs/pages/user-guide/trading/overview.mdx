### Overview

Trading on Sapience means you’re participating in onchain prediction markets where every outcome, trade, and payout is transparent. The system is built to serve everyone — from casual forecasters to pro traders — with features that make trading efficient, fair, and composable.

**Architecture Overview**

- Sapience supports different market types (binary outcomes, numeric / continuous, conditional marketplaces like parlays).
- There are two main liquidity structures: batch auctions and CLOB-style (central order book) setups, depending on how active or long-lived the market is.
- USDe serves as the native collateral: it’s reward-bearing, meaning holding or using USDe has yield advantages baked in.
- Liquidity doesn’t stay locked in inactive markets; it moves where demand exists, so pricing and depth stay healthier.
