# Overview

## What are prediction markets?

Prediction markets are trading platforms where participants wager on the outcomes of future events. Unlike traditional betting, these markets create tradable positions that reflect the collective probability of an outcome occurring. When someone believes an event is likely or not, they can take the current odds or wager against them.

## Why Sapience?

Sapience is community‑first with no fees collected by an exchange, fully [open source](https://github.com/sapiencexyz/sapience), and trustless by design—immutable smart contracts and decentralized settlement remove the need to trust an intermediary.

Under the hood, Sapience supports two complementary market types for different use cases. Auctions power multi‑condition predictions (parlays) with RFQ‑like matching, while spot markets enable continuous trading of single outcomes with efficient price discovery. All trading happens on [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io) using [Ethena](https://ethena.fi)'s reward‑bearing synthetic dollar USDe as collateral.

## Getting Started

You can use an Ethereum account to trade prediction markets. The [Sapience app](https://www.sapience.xyz) allows you to make an account seamlessly using email or SMS authentication and fund it seamlessly. (You can backup your private key and use the account with any other application that's built on Ethereum if you'd like.)

Builders can follow this [Getting Started guide](/builder-guide/getting-started/get-started) to create an Ethereum private key, fund it with ETH for network fees on [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io) and [Ethena](https://ethena.fi/)'s synthetic dollar [USDe](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x5d3a1ff2b6bab83b63cd9ad0787074081a52ef34) to wager.
