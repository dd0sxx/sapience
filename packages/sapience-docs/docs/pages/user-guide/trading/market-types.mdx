### Market Types

Sapience supports a variety of prediction market formats so traders and builders can choose the design best suited to their question:

- **Binary Markets** – The simplest format: Yes/No outcomes. Example: “Will Candidate X win the election?” A “Yes” share pays $1 if correct, $0 otherwise.
- **Numeric Markets** – Used when the outcome is a number or range, such as “What will ETH’s price be on December 31?” Traders can position across bands or continuous outcomes.
- **Conditional Markets (Parlays)** – Bundle multiple outcomes together into one position. Example: “Will Team A win and turnout exceed 60%?” All conditions must resolve correctly for payout. Parlays enable creative, higher-reward forecasts.
