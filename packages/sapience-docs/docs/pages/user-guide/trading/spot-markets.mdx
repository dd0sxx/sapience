# Spot Markets

## Overview

Spot Markets enable continuous trading of single outcomes. They're ideal when you want to express a view on one specific outcome with fine-grained control over your position's size.

*Yes* tokens (worth 1 USDe if the market resolves to yes) trade against USDe through an liquidity pool with concentrated liquidityâ€”similar to an onchain orderbook.

## How Spot Markets Work

Spot Markets use a **concentrated liquidity model**:

1. Liquidity providers supply capital across specific price ranges
2. Traders take positions by trading against available liquidity
3. Positions settle based on the final outcome: YES holders receive full value if the market resolves Yes, or zero if it resolves No
4. Markets can settle to binary outcomes (0 for No, 1 for Yes) or custom ranges for questions with numeric answers.
