### Verification & Settlement

#### How Markets Are Resolved

- Each market has a designated oracle or data source that reports the final outcome.
- Once resolved, payouts are distributed automatically to holders of winning shares.

#### Clarification

- If a question is ambiguous, governance or protocol moderators may clarify wording before resolution. This ensures fairness and consistency.

#### Disputes

- If participants disagree with the reported outcome, a dispute mechanism can be triggered.
- Disputes escalate to a transparent process where evidence is reviewed and final resolution is enforced onchain.
