### Market Lifecycle

#### How Markets Are Created

- A market begins with a clearly defined question, possible outcomes, and a resolution source (usually an oracle).
- Community members, core team members, or protocol-approved creators can propose and launch markets.

#### Lifecycle of a Market

1. **Creation** – Market question and rules are published onchain.
2. **Trading** – Participants buy and sell shares or build parlays while the market is live.
3. **Resolution** – When the event concludes, an oracle determines the correct outcome.
4. **Settlement** – Winning shares are redeemed automatically for $1 each, losing shares go to $0.
