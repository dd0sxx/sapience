### Risks & Safeguards

**For LPs**

- Batch auction design reduces risk of being “picked off” by toxic flow.
- Vaults spread risk across many markets, making exposure easier to manage.

**For Traders**

- Every trade and resolution is onchain, guaranteeing settlement.
- Competitive quoting means tighter spreads and fairer prices.

**For the Protocol**

- Smart contracts are open source and audited.
- Dispute mechanisms ensure market integrity even in edge cases.
