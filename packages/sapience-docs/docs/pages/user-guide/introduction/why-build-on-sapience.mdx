| **Lightning-fast builder path** |                                        Spin up your first bot in minutes.                                        |
| **Public, open-source APIs**    | GraphQL (market data), Quoter (order sizing), Batch Auction Relayer (RFQ-style liquidity), MCP (AI agent tools). |
| **Flexible liquidity design**   |          Two onchain market structures (batch auctions + CLOB) tailored to different liquidity profiles.         |
| **Transparent clearing**        |                            All trades clear onchain via batch auctions or order books.                           |
| **Fair competition**            |                             No house setting odds; counterparties are other traders.                             |
| **No arbitrary limits**         |                   No restrictions for “winning too much” — markets are open and permissionless.                  |
