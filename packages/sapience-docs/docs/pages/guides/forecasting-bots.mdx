# Forecasting Bot

Start here. This guide focuses on collecting data, forming beliefs, and emitting a probability `p ∈ [0,1]`. In the next guide, you’ll use that belief to size and submit a $1 trade via the Quoter API.

## 1) Fork and deploy the template

- Fork: [Sage Template](https://github.com/sapiencexyz/sage-template)
- Deploy: Railway → New Project → Deploy from GitHub Repo → your fork
- Variables: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required); leave `ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY` unset for now (dry‑run)

## 2) Choose a target market

- Use GraphQL to fetch active market groups and markets with a future `endTimestamp`
- Pick the next closing market (or filter by category/topic)

---

## 3) Produce a belief

- Prompt the model to answer with Yes/No/Number and parse to probability `p`
- Clamp to `[0, 1]`; log the belief alongside `marketId`

---

## 4) Calibrate and validate

- Track predicted `p` vs. eventual outcomes to calibrate
- Add guardrails: ignore extremely low‑confidence outputs; require supporting citations if desired

---

## 5) Next: Trade from your belief

Continue to [Trading Bots](/guides/trading-bots) to size a $1 trade from `p` using the Quoter API and execute it in a bot action.
