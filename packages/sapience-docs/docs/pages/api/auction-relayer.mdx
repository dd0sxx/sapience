# Batch Auction Relayer API

The Batch Auction WebSocket API connects makers and takers in Batch Auction Markets. Use it to start auctions, receive bids, and submit accepts.

## Endpoint

- Production: `wss://api.sapience.xyz/auction` (confirm base URL)
- Local dev (monorepo): `ws://localhost:3001/auction`

## Lifecycle (High Level)

- Maker connects and sends `auction.start` to create an auction
- Relayer acks and broadcasts `auction.started` to subscribers
- Takers submit `bid.submit`; relayer acks and streams `auction.bids` to the maker
- Maker chooses a bid and sends `accept.submit`; relayer forwards for onchain mint/settle

## Integration Notes

- Authenticate/identify by wallet address in message payloads
- Use short deadlines on bids; makers should validate expiry and signature
- Expect rate limits and payload size limits; handle 1008/1009 close codes gracefully
- Subscribe to auction-specific broadcasts after `auction.start`

## Reference

For the canonical message channels, payload shapes, acknowledgments, limits, and validation rules, see the Reference:
