# Oracles & Settlement

Sapience markets resolve via oracle-attested outcomes.

## UMA

- UMA provides dispute-based verification and finality windows
- Both market types (Yes Contract Markets/CLOB and Batch Auction/Intent) reference UMA outcome data to settle positions
- Typical UMA finality: proposal minutes–hours; dispute hours–days (market-dependent); final after dispute window elapses without valid challenge

## Settlement Interfaces

- Yes Contract Markets (CLOB): settlement adapter updates outcome and PnL
- Batch Auction Markets (Auction/Intent): settlement adapter clears positions

Adapters are versioned and kept minimal so new oracle flows can be plugged in without breaking the core trade model.

## Alternative Flows

We are actively exploring non-UMA verification, including optimistic and zk attestations. The interfaces are designed to support pluggable settlement.
