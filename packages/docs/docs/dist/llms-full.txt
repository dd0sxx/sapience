## For Resource Consumers

### Preliminary UI Concept for L2 Implementation

![Mock up](/images/ss2.png "Mock up")


## Ethereum L1 Gas Implementation

![Diagram](/images/Diagram1.png "Diagram")

The Foil protocol’s backend architecture is structured as an expiring contract that utilizes Uniswap liquidity pools for price discovery.

Collateral and positions are managed by a protocol settlement contract that exclusively controls deposits and withdrawals of settlement assets into and out of the protocol vault as well as virtual base/quote tokens into and out of the liquidity pool.

Foil’s architecture is modular and can be implemented in any chain and for any on-chain resource with minimal changes.

### Ethereum Mainnet Gas Implementation

The Ethereum Ethereum Gas market is the generic implementation of Foil protocol. It’s main components are:

* **The Foil settlement contract**: which holds collateral assets (which can be any flavor of ETH, like LST and LRTs), mints virtual asset tokens, and handles payouts on settlement. 

- **Uniswap V3/V4**: Virtual asset tokens are traded on a concentrated liquidity AMM, where price discovery occurs. 

* **Virtual asset tokens**: vGAS or vGWEI tokens are issued by the Foil settlement contract and represent long and short positions, respectively. There is a unique pool and pair of tokens for every expiry. Additionally, Virtual asset tokens can only be traded on the predetermined AMM pool and not elsewhere. 

- **Decentralized Oracle:** Any decentralized offchain compute service (like Chainlink and Pyth) can be used for settlement. Upon settlement, the oracle provides a price at which a given market will expire, defining payouts due from the Foil settlement contract. 

The process for opening a position consists of the following operations: 1) depositing collateral to a vault contract via a clearing contract, 2) issuance of virtual tokens (e.g. either vGAS or vGWEI) by the clearing contract on behalf of the user, and 3) transfer of issued virtual tokens into a concentrated liquidity pool by the clearing contract on behalf of the user. 

To force convergence between the market and index prices, a mean gas price used for settlement is provided via trustless offchain computation using a permissionless function in the clearing contract. In the version of Foil described here, it will not be possible for users to open leveraged positions. This is enforced via strict overcollateralization requirements (e.g. 10x) for positions on the short side of the market and maximum leverage of 1x on the long side of the market. To eliminate potential tail risks from black swan scenarios where the index price has increased well beyond its normal range (e.g. >10x), Foil liquidity pools will enforce predefined trading ranges that mathematically eliminate any possibility of liquidation. 

#### Examples

##### Resource Producer

1. User wants to provide OTM short liquidity

2. Deposits 100 ETH collateral to account

   * Clearinghouse credits 100 ETH to User’s account

   * (note that ETH is used here but Foil’s modular design enables support for any flavor of ETH to be trivially substituted)

3. GAS market price at 10 GWEI (vGAS/vGWEI pool) \[Oracle price = avg(30days)]

4. Wants to sell 1B vGAS from 10-30 vGWEI price range

5. Mints 1B vGAS, supplies to 10-30 vGWEI tick ranges

6. GAS market price moves to 40 GWEI at settlement 

   * Passing through 10-30 vGWEI range means user sold all 1B GAS tokens for 20B vGWEI tokens (@vGAS/vGWEI = 20) - *could be more with fees* 

     * (took net short 1B vGAS position at 20 vGWEI)

     * User has 20B vGWEI tokens and owes 1B vGAS tokens

   * Settlement price is 40 vGWEI so user can close 1B short from 20 vGWEI at 40 GvWEI

     * Net loss 20 vGWEI \* 1B vGAS = 20 ETH

7. User settles position 

   * Settlement = user can exchange vGWEI for vGAS at 40:1 exchange rate

   * Swaps 20B vGWEI tokens for 500M vGAS tokens

     * (owes 1B vGAS tokens)

   * Needs to acquire another 500M vGAS tokens for 20B vGWEI tokens 

   * 20B vGWEI = 20 ETH

   * Clearinghouse deducts User’s account balance by 20 ETH

8. User withdraws 80 ETH from account 

##### Resource Consumer

1. User is an exchange operator who regularly posts withdrawal txn batches to L1 (\~30B gas/month)

2. Current 30D average gas price is \~25 Gwei

3. User checks vGAS/vGWEI pool

   1. 30B vGAS is available to buy for an average price of 35 vGWEI

4. User deposits 30\*35 = 1050 ETH to buy 30B vGAS at average price of 35 vGWEI (1x long)

   1. Clearinghouse credits 1050 ETH to User’s account

5. 1.05T vGWEI minted and sent to pool to buy 30B vGAS 

6. At settlement time GAS index price is 50 Gwei 

   1. i.e. user can exchange 30B vGAS tokens for 1.5T vGWEI tokens

   2. Net gain 15 vGWEI \* 30B vGAS = 450 ETH

7. User settles position 

   1. Redeems 30B vGAS for 1.5T vGWEI via clearing contract

   2. 1.5T vGWEI = 1500 ETH

8. User can either close or roll

   1. Close - user withdraws 1500 ETH from clearinghouse

   2. Roll - user withdraws and reopens position in n+1 or n+2 month (if staggered)


## Ethereum L2 Gas Implementation

![Diagram](/images/Diagram3.png "Diagram")

Ethereum L1 gas market liquidity is hard to scale given the cashflow mismatch problem introduced by EIP-1559 (the base fee is the main component of the fee the user wants to hedge). After EIP1559, the base fee gets burnt instead of going to validators, limiting validator revenue to priority tips. This in turn limits validators to sell block production upfront at a liquidity level that doesn’t meet demand.

Rollups with centralized sequencers, as well as Gnosis Chain, have a specific address that earns the totality or a majority of the user fee. Foil can use an NFT issued to the fee collector address, which allows the address to collateralise its positions with future fee revenue. Two different implementations are:

#### Implementation A:

* Fee Collector Address holds NFT collateral in Foil protocol account
* An automated LP vault LPs a governance-defined range
* There is consistent distributed liquidity of Foil subscriptions for users

#### Implementation B:

* Fee Collector Address holds NFT collateral in Foil protocol account
* A Safe module is built to enable governance-triggered auctions of Foil subscriptions
* Via governance, large agreements can be settled between the Fee Collector Address and consistent consumers of blockspace in the given L2 or sidechain.


## Market Settlement

The Foil protocol architecture is modular, allowing different deployments to utilize different strategies for determining the settlement price after the expiration of a given market.

### UMA

[UMA](https://uma.xyz/)’s Optimistic Oracle can be used to determine the settlement price for a Foil market.

* After `block.timestamp` exceeds the `endTime` of the market, all market activity (including deposits and withdrawals) is halted, and an asserter can call submitFinalPrice with a settlementPrice for the market, also providing a bond (configurable, typically 5,000 USDC).
* During a challenge window (configurable, typically two hours by default) following submission, anyone can dispute this settlement price by posting an equal-sized bond.
* If no dispute is submitted during this period, anyone can call settle. Market participants can then withdraw collateral based on the value of their position according to the settlement price.
* If a dispute is submitted, UMA tokenholders vote during a 48-96 hour voting period to determine whether the assertion is true or false.
  * If the vote resolves to true, the dispute loses their bond, and the system behaves as if no dispute was submitted.
  * If the vote resolves to false, the asserter loses their bond, and another settlement price must be submitted.


![Opportunity: Everything Onchain](/images/Foil_Header3.png "Opportunity: Everything Onchain")

The gas economy is by far the largest cryptonative market today.

The suite of onchain resources available to builders is in a state of rapid expansion (blobspace markets on Ethereum, Celestia, EigenDA, etc., Solana, other L1 blockspace).

While sporadic usage trends have tended to dominate in the past, commercial entities with more industrial consumption trends are accounting for an increasingly large share of onchain activity and a secular trend towards further demand aggregation is expected to continue into the future.


## Price Glossary

The Foil protocol and app reference many different types of prices.

* **Resource Price**: The price actually paid for the underlying resource at a given time. For example, if a block on Ethereum mainnet has a base fee per gas of 10 gwei, this would be the resource price for the timestamp on that block. This is represented by a green line in the Foil app.
* **Index Price**: The average resource price over a given period. This doesn’t exist before the start time of the period and is effectively a Settlement Price estimate while the period is in progress. This is represented by a dashed blue line in the Foil app.
* **Market Price**: The price that someone can buy or sell in the Foil protocol. This is represented by red and green candlesticks in the Foil app.
* **Settlement Price**: The Index Price at the end of a period. After the period ends, market participants exit their positions at this price.
* **Trailing Average Resource Price**: The average resource price over a previous duration. This may be useful to see what a Settlement Price would be for a hypothetical period that ended at a given time. This is represented by a solid blue line in the Foil app.

**8.  What is Our Legal Basis**\*\*?\*\*

In some jurisdiction like the European Union and the E.E.A., we only collect, use, or share information about you when we have a valid reason. This is called a "lawful basis." Specifically, this is one of the following:

* The consent you provide to us at the point of collection of your information;
* The performance of the contract we have with you;
* The compliance of a legal obligation to which we are subject; or
* The "legitimate interests" of Foil or a third party. 

The term "legitimate interest" is a technical term under international laws including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. It means that there are good reasons for the processing of your personal information and that we take measures to minimize the impact on your privacy rights and interests. The term also refers to our use of your data in ways you would reasonably expect and have a minimal privacy impact. 

We have a legitimate interest in gathering and processing personal information, for example to: (a) ensure that our networks and information are secure; (b) administer and generally conduct business within Foil; (c) prevent fraud; and (d) conduct our marketing activities.

We use reasonable procedural, physical, and electronic safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized access or use. These security measures are designed to protect against the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, misuse, alteration, and unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, the information under our control. However, no method or transmission over the internet or electronic system is completely secure, so we are unable to guarantee absolute security. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Do not share your private cryptographic key with anyone. We may provide you with additional security features like multifactor authentication, and we strongly recommend that you utilize these features. 

**10.  Information Storage**

We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, fulfill our legal obligations, enforce our legal agreements, and resolve disputes. The retention periods for your information are determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature of information, why it was collected, and the applicable legal reason(s) for the retention of your information. We may also keep certain information when necessary to protect the safety and security of the Services. Rather than delete your data, we might de-identify it by removing identifying information.

**11.  Age Restrictions**

The Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children. In the event that we encounter information from an individual under the age of 18, we will promptly take steps to delete such information.

![Problem: Predictable Onchain Expenditures](/images/Foil_Header1.png "Problem: Predictable Onchain Expenditures")

Onchain resources (e.g. gas, blobspace) are subject to unstable supply/demand dynamics.

While volatile costs can reasonably be passed through to sophisticated onchain power users, most consumer-grade applications will abstract these costs away from end-users and consolidate them through paymasters (operated on behalf of layer 2 sequencers, RaaS providers, account abstraction services, centralized exchanges, etc.).

These businesses will naturally prefer to stabilize costs where possible to enable fixed cost pricing models for clients.


## For Resource Producers

### Preliminary UI Concept for L2 Implementation

![Mock up](/images/ss1.png "Mock up")


![Solution: Foil Onchain Marketplace](/images/Foil_Header2.png "Solution: Foil Onchain Marketplace")

In order to offer price-stabilized agreements to clients, paymasters require a liquid marketplace to offload risk, which currently does not exist at scale.  This class of product has traditionally been difficult to scale.

Foil represents a modular approach to gas marketplaces by providing an onchain marketplace for producers of onchain resources to trustlessly transact with consumers.


## Terms of Service

The Platform is one but not the exclusive means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol itself is comprised of open-source or source-available self-executing smart contracts.

You acknowledge and agree that we do not control the Protocol and do not have control over Digital Asset transactions conducted on the Protocol. You also acknowledge and agree that that your interactions and/or transactions, including Digital Asset transactions, are not transactions with us. You further understand and agree that we do not own, operate, or control the Protocol's liquidity pools and do not control trade execution on the Protocol. 

**4.  THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND WAIVER**

The Services may include, without limitation, links to sites, technology, applications, products, services, materials, or resources, provided or made available by a third party (collectively, "Third Party Services"). Your access and/or use of a Third Party Service is subject to the terms and policies of the applicable provider of the Third Party Service. We do not control any Third Party Service. 

**4.1.  Third Party Services**

You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all costs and charges associated with your use of a Third Party Service. Our integration or inclusion of a Third Party Service does not imply endorsement or recommendation. You also acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability, reliability, accuracy, or legitimacy of any Third Party Service (including any related websites, resources or links displayed therein). Any dispute you have with a Third Party Service provider including, without limitation, your intellectual property rights, is between you and the applicable provider of the Third Party Service. We will not be responsible or liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by, or in connection with, your use of, or reliance on, a Third Party Service.

If, to the extent we permit, you permit a third party or Third Party Service to access or connect to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that granting permission to any third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under these Terms. You are fully responsible for any act or omission of any third party. You acknowledge and agree that you will not hold us responsible for, and will indemnify us from, any and all liability arising out of or related to any third party's act or omission with access to your Digital Asset Wallet, application, software, or other mechanism that you use to interact with the Services.

**4.2.  Waiver of Claims**

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you waive any and all claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, against us and our affiliates, and each of our respective officers, employees, agents, and successors arising out of or in any way related to any of the risks set forth herein. You also waive application of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, or any similar stature or law of any other jurisdiction. Section 1542 reads as follows: "a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor." 

**5.  REWARDS**

We may provide certain incentives, prizes, or rewards for completing certain activities ("Rewards"). We reserve the right to change, modify, discontinue, or cancel any Reward at any time and without notice to you. You understand and agree that we do not guarantee that you will receive a Reward or other incentive. Any information regarding the potential amount of a Reword is an estimate only. We expressly disclaim all representations and warranties regarding any Reward including, without limitation: (a) any stated percentage of a Reward that will be received; (b) any Reward will occur on a continuous basis; (c) that Rewards will be on an uninterrupted basis or error-free basis; and/or (d) any particular Digital Asset will be available in connection with the Reward. Any Reward we make available from time to time is subject to these Terms and any other applicable term or provision regarding such Reward. Some or all of your Rewards may be programmatically destroyed as a penalty imposed by the applicable underlying blockchain network ("Slashing Penalty"). Foil will not be responsible or liable for any loss or penalty of a Reward or Slashing Penalty.

**6.  RISK DISCLOSURES**

You understand, accept, and agree to assume all of the various risks involved in using the Services and holding, transacting, and transferring Digital Assets including all of the risks set forth below.

* Digital Assets, the features, functions, characteristics, operations, use, and other properties and/or software, networks, protocols, systems, or other technology that Digital Assets interact with is complex; and Digital Asset terms, features, or risks may not be readily or fully understood due to such complexities. 
* If you act as a liquidity provider through the Services, you understand that your Digital Asset may lose some or all value while supplied to the Protocol due to fluctuations in Digital Asset prices in a trading pair or liquidity pool. 
* Staking rewards are not guaranteed and may be based on network performance, validator reliability, and other external factors. Foil does not assure any specific level of returns or profitability from staking activities. 
* If you supply Digital Asset to a liquidity pool in an automated market maker ("AMM"), your deposited assets may lose relative value as the ratio of the Digital Assets in the liquidity pool fluctuate ("Impermanent Loss"). An AMM functions by allowing market forces to rebalance the ratio of Digital Assets in a liquidity pool. Once this rebalancing or Digital Assets occurs, you may end up withdrawing a different ratio of Digital Assets than when you deposited your Digital Assets into the liquidity pool. As such, you may perceive a "loss" in value in U.S. dollar terms due to the rebalancing of the Digital Assets in the liquidity pool. You represent that you understand the risk of Impermanent Loss. You further represent that you have carefully considered the likelihood of price divergence in a liquidity pool, and that you understand that we cannot control the amount of loss that you incur.
* You understand that we do not create, own, or operate cross-chain bridges and we do not make any representation or warranty about the safety or soundness of any cross chain bridge.
* Digital Assets will be irretrievably lost if sent to the wrong address. For instance, if the address is improperly formatted, contains an error, or for a different type of Digital Asset. 
* Digital Assets may be subject to forks or attacks on the security, integrity, and/or operation of the networks, including any network events. These events may affect features, functionality, operations, use, or properties of any Digital Asset or network and/or the value of any Digital Asset.
* The value of certain Digital Assets like non-fungible tokens ("NFTs") is subjective. The price of a NFTs is subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price of other Digital Assets.
* Collateral for decentralized finance protocols and projects may be higher than similar centralized protocols and projects.
* Any Digital Asset and/or the Services may be targeted by malicious persons or individuals who may attempt to disrupt the Services or steal Digital Assets. This includes but is not limited to malware, hacking, phishing, double spending, smurfing, spoofing, sybil attacks, social engineering, majority mining, mining attacks, distributed denial of service, and blockchain forks.
* The public nature of the Internet means that parts or the Internet may be unreliable or unavailable at any given time. Interruption, delay, corruption, loss of data, the loss of confidentiality or privacy through the course of data transmission, or malware transmission may occur when transmitting data via the Internet or other technology. This can result in your transaction(s) not being executed according to your instructions, at the requested time, and/or not at all. No technology is completely secure or safe.
* Digital Assets may decrease in value or lose all value, in a short period of time or permanently, due to various factors including, without limitation, government or regulatory activity, the discovery of wrongful or illegal conduct, market manipulation, price distortion, insider dealing, market distortion, malicious wrongdoing or behaviors, changes to the Digital Asset's nature or characteristics, suspension, or cessation of support for a Digital Asset by exchanges, public opinion, technical advancements, macroeconomic and political factors, and other factors outside of our control
* Digital Assets held by a decentralized application and Digital Asset Wallets are not protected deposits and may not be protected by any deposit protection scheme. Thus, Digital Assets have a reduced level and type of protection compared to fiat and other asset classes or types.
* The creation of the Protocol may be abandoned for reasons including without limitation, lack of interest, funding, incapacitation of key developers or project members, lack of commercial success or prospects, or Force Majeure Event (defined below). You understand that there are no assurances regarding any benefit to interacting with the Services, even if the project and/or the Protocol was partially or fully developed and launched.
* The Services may undergo significant changes over time. We may also limit control over how other visitors and/or users can use the Services and what services are offered on or through the Platform. This could create the risk of the Services not meeting your expectations, for any number of reasons, including mistaken assumptions or analysis, a change in the design and/or implementation plans, or execution on or through the Services. 
* We currently rely on our service providers for certain aspects of our operations including cloud computing services and data centers that provide facilities, infrastructure, website functionality and access, components, and services, all of which are critical to our operations. Like most other online companies, because we rely on service providers, we face operational risk. Any interruption in the services provided by our service providers can impair our ability to provide the Services.
* We do not directly manage the operation of the service providers we use including their data center facilities. Such third parties are vulnerable to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, cybersecurity incidents, break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, privacy breaches, service terminations, disruptions, interruptions, Force Majeure Events, and other events. 
* Digital Asset transactions rely on smart contracts stored on various blockchains, cryptographic tokens generated by smart contracts, and other nascent software, applications and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. These technologies are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and subject to change. A defining feature of blockchain technology is that its entries are immutable, which means, as a technical matter, they generally cannot be deleted or modified by anyone. You acknowledge and understand that smart contracts dictate how funds and ownership of Digital Assets are distributed.
* You acknowledge and understand that you may be subject to scams and/or other types of fraud perpetrated by parties outside of our control. It is your responsibility to be aware of and protect against such misconduct. In the event that you are subject to such fraud, there is a risk of loss of your Digital Assets.
* All blockchain transactions include data and, in some circumstances, personal data about you. Many blockchain technologies store transaction data publicly and permanently. When you use such public blockchain technology, you intentionally make your transaction data public and acknowledge that this data cannot be deleted, removed, or reversed due to the nature of blockchain technology.
* We are subject to an extensive and rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, and any changes to any law or regulation could adversely impact our ability to offer the Services and/or your use or access to the Services. Such regulatory change may also impact your legal obligations with respect to your use of the Services.
* You understand that smart contract transactions automatically execute and settle, and blockchain-based transactions are irreversible when confirmed. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk of selecting your slippage rate which expose you to additional cost or fees by the underlying blockchain network.

**21.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION, WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION, AND MANDATORY ARBITRATION**

Please read this section carefully because it waives any right to participate in any class action or other representative action or proceeding. This section requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and limits the ways in which you can seek relief, including by precluding you from suing in court or having a jury trial. 

**21.1.  Waiver of Class Actions and Right to Jury Trial**

To the extent permissible by law, any claim, controversy, or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, or any products or services provided in connection with the Services (each a "Dispute") must be brought in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any putative class, collective action, or representative proceeding (collectively "Class Action Waiver"). The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims or engage in any arbitration on behalf of a class. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you are waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class action.

**21.2.  Informal  Resolution** 

Before filing a claim against Foil, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute by first emailing [oxideinc@proton.me](mailto\:oxideinc@proton.me) with a description of your claim and proof of your relationship with Foil. If we can't resolve the Dispute within sixty days of our receipt of your first email, you or Foil may then submit the Dispute to binding arbitration as provided herein.

**21.3. Arbitration Agreement**

All Disputes between you and Foil must be resolved by final and binding arbitration. By agreeing to binding arbitration, you and Foil expressly waive the right to formal court proceedings including without limitation trial by jury and class action. This Agreement affects interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act 9 U.S.C. § 1, et. Seq. ("FAA").

**21.4. Conducting Arbitration**

The arbitration shall be conducted by the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules ("ICC Rules") then in effect. If you are a consumer, the most recent version of the ICC Rules can be accessed [here](https://iccwbo.org/dispute-resolution/dispute-resolution-services/arbitration/rules-procedure/2021-arbitration-rules/). These Terms shall govern any conflict between the ICC Rules and these Terms. The location and type of hearing shall be determined in accordance with the ICC Rules. Further, a party's right to request a hearing shall also be determined in accordance with the ICC Rules. Unless otherwise ordered by an arbitrator or pursuant to the ICC Rules, any in-person arbitration shall be in English and held remotely to the maximum extent and administered in the Republic of Panama or another mutually agreeable location. 

**21.5. Confidentiality**

Foil, the arbitrator, and you, will each maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments, and awards including information shared and produced during the arbitration.

**21.6. Arbitration Time for Filing**

Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim. If applicable law prohibits a one year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. If a claim is not filed within such period, the Dispute is permanently barred.

**21.7.  Severability**

If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms and such severance of the provision(s) shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section. Further, to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Lastly, if any provision in this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, such provision shall have no effect to the extent relief is allowed to be sought outside of arbitration. The remainder of this section shall remain in full force and effect.

**21.8.  Modification**

Notwithstanding any term or provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and Foil agree that if Foil makes any future material change to this section, we will notify you. Your continued use of the Services including the acceptance of features and services offered following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.

**22.  GOVERNING LAW**

This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the Republic of Panama without regard to conflict of law rules or principles that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that Foil may initiate a proceeding relating to the enforceability or validity of Foil's intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. With respect to any other proceeding not subject to arbitration under this Agreement, the courts of the Republic of Panama will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts. 

**23.  AMENDMENTS TO THIS AGREEMENT**

We reserve the right to amend this Agreement, any other agreement or document incorporated or referenced in this Agreement, and any policy governing the use of the Services at any time and in our sole discretion. Any amendment will be effective immediately and you waive any right you may have to receive any specific notice of such amendment. Your continued use of the Services after posting of such amendment constitutes your agreement to be bound by all then-in-effect amendments to this Agreement, regardless of whether you have actually reviewed them.

## Token Vault

![Diagram](/images/Diagram2.png "Diagram")

To reduce the opportunity cost of providing liquidity, Foil will also offer tokenized shares for passive liquidity vaults which will be composable throughout DeFi to be used in external liquidity pools, lending protocols, etc.

The Foil token vault implementation for L1 will take margin deposits and automatically provide full-range liquidity. This will enable any holder of the Foil token vault to passively earn additional yield on top of LST/LRT base yield.

It is important to note that L1 gas price liquidity provision is attractive to LPs given that gas is highly volatile and tends to mean revert. Additionally, LPs exposure to toxic order flow is minimal given that there is no spot gas market to arbitrage against.
