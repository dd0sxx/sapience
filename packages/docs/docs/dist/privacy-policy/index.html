<p class="vocs_Paragraph">Your personal information may be transferred, processed, and/or stored in countries other than the country in which you are a resident. If we transfer your data out of the European Economic Area (E.E.A.), we implement at least one of the two following safeguards:</p>
<ul class="vocs_List vocs_List_unordered">
<li class="vocs_ListItem">We transfer your information to countries that have been recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of date protection according to E.E.A. standards (see the full list of these countries <a class="vocs_Anchor vocs_Link vocs_Link_accent" href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="--vocs_ExternalLink_iconUrl:url(/.vocs/icons/arrow-diagonal.svg)">here</a>).</li>
<li class="vocs_ListItem">We confirm that the service provider to which we are transferring data has an active self-certification under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF, as applicable.</li>
<li class="vocs_ListItem">We take steps to ensure that the receipt is bound by contractual obligations, including E.U. Standard Contractual Clause together with addenda or language to cover the UK and/or Switzerland, as applicable, and additional safeguards to protect your personal data (see a copy of these clauses <a class="vocs_Anchor vocs_Link vocs_Link_accent" href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="--vocs_ExternalLink_iconUrl:url(/.vocs/icons/arrow-diagonal.svg)">here</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p class="vocs_Paragraph"><strong class="vocs_Strong">8.  What is Our Legal Basis</strong>**?**</p>
<p class="vocs_Paragraph">In some jurisdiction like the European Union and the E.E.A., we only collect, use, or share information about you when we have a valid reason. This is called a &quot;lawful basis.&quot; Specifically, this is one of the following:</p>
<ul class="vocs_List vocs_List_unordered">
<li class="vocs_ListItem">The consent you provide to us at the point of collection of your information;</li>
<li class="vocs_ListItem">The performance of the contract we have with you;</li>
<li class="vocs_ListItem">The compliance of a legal obligation to which we are subject; or</li>
<li class="vocs_ListItem">The &quot;legitimate interests&quot; of Foil or a third party. </li>
</ul>
<p class="vocs_Paragraph">The term &quot;legitimate interest&quot; is a technical term under international laws including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. It means that there are good reasons for the processing of your personal information and that we take measures to minimize the impact on your privacy rights and interests. The term also refers to our use of your data in ways you would reasonably expect and have a minimal privacy impact. </p>
<p class="vocs_Paragraph">We have a legitimate interest in gathering and processing personal information, for example to: (a) ensure that our networks and information are secure; (b) administer and generally conduct business within Foil; (c) prevent fraud; and (d) conduct our marketing activities.</p>
<strong class="vocs_Strong">9.  How We Protect Your Information</strong>
<p class="vocs_Paragraph">We use reasonable procedural, physical, and electronic safeguards to protect your information from unauthorized access or use. These security measures are designed to protect against the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, misuse, alteration, and unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, the information under our control. However, no method or transmission over the internet or electronic system is completely secure, so we are unable to guarantee absolute security. The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Do not share your private cryptographic key with anyone. We may provide you with additional security features like multifactor authentication, and we strongly recommend that you utilize these features. </p>
<strong class="vocs_Strong">10.  Information Storage</strong>
<p class="vocs_Paragraph">We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, fulfill our legal obligations, enforce our legal agreements, and resolve disputes. The retention periods for your information are determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature of information, why it was collected, and the applicable legal reason(s) for the retention of your information. We may also keep certain information when necessary to protect the safety and security of the Services. Rather than delete your data, we might de-identify it by removing identifying information.</p>
<strong class="vocs_Strong">11.  Age Restrictions</strong>
<p class="vocs_Paragraph">The Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children. In the event that we encounter information from an individual under the age of 18, we will promptly take steps to delete such information. If you believe your child under the age of 18 has uploaded information in connection with the Services, please contact us using the information in the <strong class="vocs_Strong">Contact Us</strong> section below.</p>
<strong class="vocs_Strong">12.  Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong>
<p class="vocs_Paragraph">We are always improving the Services, and we create new features regularly. These updates sometimes require us to collect new information or use what we already have differently. Further, the laws regarding personal information and privacy frequently change. We will notify you of any changes we make by revising the date at the top of this page. We may also provide you with a reasonable notice of any material changes before they take effect or as otherwise required by applicable law. If you object to any change, you can stop using the Services. After we post any changes, your continued use of the Services is subject to the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
<strong class="vocs_Strong">13.  Third Party Links and Features</strong>
<p class="vocs_Paragraph">The Services may contain links, banners, and/or widgets to third party sites, applications, or services. We may also incorporate third party software (including open source software) in the Services. These links and features are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of information provided through these third party links and features, nor any association with their operators. Foil is not responsible for the practices of such third parties. Any information you provide to third parties on their sites or services is covered under their privacy and data collection practices and not covered by this Privacy Policy.
