You are prohibited from using any software or networking techniques including a Virtual Private Network (&quot;VPN&quot;) to modify your internet protocol address or otherwise circumvent or attempt to circumvent this prohibition. You acknowledge and agree that you will not hold us responsible for, and will indemnify us from, any contravention that may result from the access of the Services through a VPN or any similar means.</p>\n<strong>1.3.  Changes to Your Eligibility</strong>\n<p>You hereby represent and warrant to us that you will notify us of any change in your circumstances which may affect your ability to meet the eligibility criteria or may result in a change to the Services available to you. If you no longer meet our eligibility criteria at any time (including because of a change to your circumstances or to our eligibility criteria), we may suspend or terminate your ability to access and/or use some or all of the Services.  </p>\n<strong>2.  Digital Asset Wallets</strong>\n<p>To use certain functions of the Services, you must connect a compatible software application (or other mechanism) (&quot;Digital Asset Wallet&quot;). Your relationship with the provider of any Digital Asset Wallet you use in connection with the Services is governed by the terms and conditions of that provider&#x27;s agreement with you. By connecting a Digital Asset Wallet to the Platform, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to prohibit certain Digital Asset Wallet&#x27;s from connecting to the Platform or from interacting with any part of the Services.</p>\n<strong>2.1.  Non-Custodial</strong>\n<p>The Services are non-custodial applications; we do not, at any time, custody, possess, or control the virtual currency, cryptocurrency, stablecoins, or other cryptographic tokens (collectively, &quot;Digital Assets&quot;) in your Digital Asset Wallet. As the owner of the Digital Assets stored by the Digital Asset Wallet, you acknowledge and agree that you bear all risk of loss regarding such Digital Assets and you will not hold us liable for Digital Asset fluctuations or other loss associated with any Digital Asset Wallet you use in connection with the Services. </p>\n<strong>2.2.  Security</strong>\n<p>You are solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys associated with any Digital Asset Wallet you use or connect to the Services. You should never share your Digital Asset Wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. We accept no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a Digital Asset Wallet. We make no representations or warranties regarding how any of the Services will interact or operate with any specific Digital Asset Wallet. </p>\n<strong>3.  THE PLATFORM</strong>\n<p>The Platform provides a web or mobile-based means to access software protocols that run on blockchain networks (collectively, the &quot;Protocol&quot;). The Protocol enables users to perform transactions with Digital Assets compatible with the underlying blockchain network. The Platform is distinct from the Protocol. The Platform is one but not the exclusive means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol itself is comprised of open-source or source-available self-executing smart contracts.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that we do not control the Protocol and do not have control over Digital Asset transactions conducted on the Protocol. You also acknowledge and agree that that your interactions and/or transactions, including Digital Asset transactions, are not transactions with us. You further understand and agree that we do not own, operate, or control the Protocol&#x27;s liquidity pools and do not control trade execution on the Protocol. </p>\n<strong>4.  THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND WAIVER</strong>\n<p>The Services may include, without limitation, links to sites, technology, applications, products, services, materials, or resources, provided or made available by a third party (collectively, &quot;Third Party Services&quot;). Your access and/or use of a Third Party Service is subject to the terms and policies of the applicable provider of the Third Party Service. We do not control any Third Party Service. </p>\n<strong>4.1.  Third Party Services</strong>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all costs and charges associated with your use of a Third Party Service. Our integration or inclusion of a Third Party Service does not imply endorsement or recommendation. You also acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability, reliability, accuracy, or legitimacy of any Third Party Service (including any related websites, resources or links displayed therein). Any dispute you have with a Third Party Service provider including, without limitation, your intellectual property rights, is between you and the applicable provider of the Third Party Service. We will not be responsible or liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by, or in connection with, your use of, or reliance on, a Third Party Service.</p>\n<p>If, to the extent we permit, you permit a third party or Third Party Service to access or connect to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that granting permission to any third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under these Terms. You are fully responsible for any act or omission of any third party. You acknowledge and agree that you will not hold us responsible for, and will indemnify us from, any and all liability arising out of or related to any third party&#x27;s act or omission with access to your Digital Asset Wallet, application, software, or other mechanism that you use to interact with the Services.</p>\n<strong>4.2.  Waiver of Claims</strong>\n<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you waive any and all claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, against us and our affiliates, and each of our respective officers, employees, agents, and successors arising out of or in any way related to any of the risks set forth herein. You also waive application of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, or any similar stature or law of any other jurisdiction. Section 1542 reads as follows: &quot;a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.&quot; </p>\n<strong>5.  REWARDS</strong>\n<p>We may provide certain incentives, prizes, or rewards for completing certain activities (&quot;Rewards&quot;). We reserve the right to change, modify, discontinue, or cancel any Reward at any time and without notice to you. You understand and agree that we do not guarantee that you will receive a Reward or other incentive. Any information regarding the potential amount of a Reword is an estimate only. We expressly disclaim all representations and warranties regarding any Reward including, without limitation: (a) any stated percentage of a Reward that will be received; (b) any Reward will occur on a continuous basis; (c) that Rewards will be on an uninterrupted basis or error-free basis; and/or (d) any particular Digital Asset will be available in connection with the Reward. Any Reward we make available from time to time is subject to these Terms and any other applicable term or provision regarding such Reward. Some or all of your Rewards may be programmatically destroyed as a penalty imposed by the applicable underlying blockchain network (&quot;Slashing Penalty&quot;). Foil will not be responsible or liable for any loss or penalty of a Reward or Slashing Penalty.</p>\n<strong>6.  RISK DISCLOSURES</strong>\n<p>You understand, accept, and agree to assume all of the various risks involved in using the Services and holding, transacting, and transferring Digital Assets including all of the risks set forth below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital Assets, the features, functions, characteristics, operations, use, and other properties and/or software, networks, protocols, systems, or other technology that Digital Assets interact with is complex; and Digital Asset terms, features, or risks may not be readily or fully understood due to such complexities. </li>\n<li>If you act as a liquidity provider through the Services, you understand that your Digital Asset may lose some or all value while supplied to the Protocol due to fluctuations in Digital Asset prices in a trading pair or liquidity pool. </li>\n<li>Staking rewards are not guaranteed and may be based on network performance, validator reliability, and other external factors. Foil does not assure any specific level of returns or profitability from staking activities. </li>\n<li>If you supply Digital Asset to a liquidity pool in an automated market maker (&quot;AMM&quot;), your deposited assets may lose relative value as the ratio of the Digital Assets in the liquidity pool fluctuate (&quot;Impermanent Loss&quot;). An AMM functions by allowing market forces to rebalance the ratio of Digital Assets in a liquidity pool. Once this rebalancing or Digital Assets occurs, you may end up withdrawing a different ratio of Digital Assets than when you deposited your Digital Assets into the liquidity pool. As such, you may perceive a &quot;loss&quot; in value in U.S. dollar terms due to the rebalancing of the Digital Assets in the liquidity pool. You represent that you understand the risk of Impermanent Loss. You further represent that you have carefully considered the likelihood of price divergence in a liquidity pool, and that you understand that we cannot control the amount of loss that you incur.</li>\n<li>You understand that we do not create, own, or operate cross-chain bridges and we do not make any representation or warranty about the safety or soundness of any cross chain bridge.</li>\n<li>Digital Assets will be irretrievably lost if sent to the wrong address. For instance, if the address is improperly formatted, contains an error, or for a different type of Digital Asset. </li>\n<li>Digital Assets may be subject to forks or attacks on the security, integrity, and/or operation of the networks, including any network events. These events may affect features, functionality, operations, use, or properties of any Digital Asset or network and/or the value of any Digital Asset.</li>\n<li>The value of certain Digital Assets like non-fungible tokens (&quot;NFTs&quot;) is subjective. The price of a NFTs is subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price of other Digital Assets.</li>\n<li>Collateral for decentralized finance protocols and projects may be higher than similar centralized protocols and projects.</li>\n<li>Any Digital Asset and/or the Services may be targeted by malicious persons or individuals who may attempt to disrupt the Services or steal Digital Assets. This includes but is not limited to malware, hacking, phishing, double spending, smurfing, spoofing, sybil attacks, social engineering, majority mining, mining attacks, distributed denial of service, and blockchain forks.</li>\n<li>The public nature of the Internet means that parts or the Internet may be unreliable or unavailable at any given time. Interruption, delay, corruption, loss of data, the loss of confidentiality or privacy through the course of data transmission, or malware transmission may occur when transmitting data via the Internet or other technology. This can result in your transaction(s) not being executed according to your instructions, at the requested time, and/or not at all. No technology is completely secure or safe.</li>\n<li>Digital Assets may decrease in value or lose all value, in a short period of time or permanently, due to various factors including, without limitation, government or regulatory activity, the discovery of wrongful or illegal conduct, market manipulation, price distortion, insider dealing, market distortion, malicious wrongdoing or behaviors, changes to the Digital Asset&#x27;s nature or characteristics, suspension, or cessation of support for a Digital Asset by exchanges, public opinion, technical advancements, macroeconomic and political factors, and other factors outside of our control</li>\n<li>Digital Assets held by a decentralized application and Digital Asset Wallets are not protected deposits and may not be protected by any deposit protection scheme. Thus, Digital Assets have a reduced level and type of protection compared to fiat and other asset classes or types.</li>\n<li>The creation of the Protocol may be abandoned for reasons including without limitation, lack of interest, funding, incapacitation of key developers or project members, lack of commercial success or prospects, or Force Majeure Event (defined below). You understand that there are no assurances regarding any benefit to interacting with the Services, even if the project and/or the Protocol was partially or fully developed and launched.</li>\n<li>The Services may undergo significant changes over time. We may also limit control over how other visitors and/or users can use the Services and what services are offered on or through the Platform. This could create the risk of the Services not meeting your expectations, for any number of reasons, including mistaken assumptions or analysis, a change in the design and/or implementation plans, or execution on or through the Services. </li>\n<li>We currently rely on our service providers for certain aspects of our operations including cloud computing services and data centers that provide facilities, infrastructure, website functionality and access, components, and services, all of which are critical to our operations. Like most other online companies, because we rely on service providers, we face operational risk. Any interruption in the services provided by our service providers can impair our ability to provide the Services.</li>\n<li>We do not directly manage the operation of the service providers we use including their data center facilities. Such third parties are vulnerable to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, cybersecurity incidents, break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, privacy breaches, service terminations, disruptions, interruptions, Force Majeure Events, and other events. </li>\n<li>Digital Asset transactions rely on smart contracts stored on various blockchains, cryptographic tokens generated by smart contracts, and other nascent software, applications and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. These technologies are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and subject to change. A defining feature of blockchain technology is that its entries are immutable, which means, as a technical matter, they generally cannot be deleted or modified by anyone. You acknowledge and understand that smart contracts dictate how funds and ownership of Digital Assets are distributed.</li>\n<li>You acknowledge and understand that you may be subject to scams and/or other types of fraud perpetrated by parties outside of our control. It is your responsibility to be aware of and protect against such misconduct. In the event that you are subject to such fraud, there is a risk of loss of your Digital Assets.</li>\n<li>All blockchain transactions include data and, in some circumstances, personal data about you. Many blockchain technologies store transaction data publicly and permanently. When you use such public blockchain technology, you intentionally make your transaction data public and acknowledge that this data cannot be deleted, removed, or reversed due to the nature of blockchain technology.</li>\n<li>We are subject to an extensive and rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, and any changes to any law or regulation could adversely impact our ability to offer the Services and/or your use or access to the Services. Such regulatory change may also impact your legal obligations with respect to your use of the Services.</li>\n<li>You understand that smart contract transactions automatically execute and settle, and blockchain-based transactions are irreversible when confirmed. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk of selecting your slippage rate which expose you to additional cost or fees by the underlying blockchain network.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>7.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION, AND MANDATORY ARBITRATION</strong>\n<p>Please read this section carefully because it waives any right to participate in any class action or other representative action or proceeding. This section requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and limits the ways in which you can seek relief, including by precluding you from suing in court or having a jury trial. </p>\n<strong>21.1.  Waiver of Class Actions and Right to Jury Trial</strong>\n<p>To the extent permissible by law, any claim, controversy, or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, or any products or services provided in connection with the Services (each a &quot;Dispute&quot;) must be brought in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any putative class, collective action, or representative proceeding (collectively &quot;Class Action Waiver&quot;). The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#x27;s claims or engage in any arbitration on behalf of a class. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you are waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class action.</p>\n<p><strong>21.2.  Informal  Resolution</strong> </p>\n<p>Before filing a claim against Foil, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute by first emailing <a href=\"mailto:oxideinc@proton.me\">oxideinc@proton.me</a> with a description of your claim and proof of your relationship with Foil. If we can&#x27;t resolve the Dispute within sixty days of our receipt of your first email, you or Foil may then submit the Dispute to binding arbitration as provided herein.</p>\n<strong>21.3. Arbitration Agreement</strong>\n<p>All Disputes between you and Foil must be resolved by final and binding arbitration. By agreeing to binding arbitration, you and Foil expressly waive the right to formal court proceedings including without limitation trial by jury and class action. This Agreement affects interstate commerce, and the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act 9 U.S.C. § 1, et. Seq. (&quot;FAA&quot;).</p>\n<strong>21.4. Conducting Arbitration</strong>\n<p>The arbitration shall be conducted by the International Chamber of Commerce (&quot;ICC&quot;) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (&quot;ICC Rules&quot;) then in effect. If you are a consumer, the most recent version of the ICC Rules can be accessed <a href=\"https://iccwbo.org/dispute-resolution/dispute-resolution-services/arbitration/rules-procedure/2021-arbitration-rules/\">here</a>. These Terms shall govern any conflict between the ICC Rules and these Terms. The location and type of hearing shall be determined in accordance with the ICC Rules. Further, a party&#x27;s right to request a hearing shall also be determined in accordance with the ICC Rules. Unless otherwise ordered by an arbitrator or pursuant to the ICC Rules, any in-person arbitration shall be in English and held remotely to the maximum extent and administered in the Republic of Panama or another mutually agreeable location. </p>\n<strong>21.5. Confidentiality</strong>\n<p>Foil, the arbitrator, and you, will each maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments, and awards including information shared and produced during the arbitration.</p>\n<strong>21.6. Arbitration Time for Filing</strong>\n<p>Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim. If applicable law prohibits a one year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. If a claim is not filed within such period, the Dispute is permanently barred.</p>\n<strong>21.7.  Severability</strong>\n<p>If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms and such severance of the provision(s) shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section. Further, to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Lastly, if any provision in this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, such provision shall have no effect to the extent relief is allowed to be sought outside of arbitration. The remainder of this section shall remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<strong>21.8.  Modification</strong>\n<p>Notwithstanding any term or provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and Foil agree that if Foil makes any future material change to this section, we will notify you. Your continued use of the Services including the acceptance of features and services offered following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.</p>\n<strong>22.  GOVERNING LAW</strong>\n<p>This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the Republic of Panama without regard to conflict of law rules or principles that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that Foil may initiate a proceeding relating to the enforceability or validity of Foil&#x27;s intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. With respect to any other proceeding not subject to arbitration under this Agreement, the courts of the Republic of Panama will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts. </p>\n<strong>23.  AMENDMENTS TO THIS AGREEMENT</strong>\n<p>We reserve the right to amend this Agreement, any other agreement or document incorporated or referenced in this Agreement, and any policy governing the use of the Services at any time and in our sole discretion. Any amendment will be effective immediately and you waive any right you may have to receive any specific notice of such amendment.

Digital Asset Wallets\nTo use certain functions of the Services, you must connect a compatible software application (or other mechanism) (&quot;Digital Asset Wallet&quot;). Your relationship with the provider of any Digital Asset Wallet you use in connection with the Services is governed by the terms and conditions of that provider&#x27;s agreement with you. By connecting a Digital Asset Wallet to the Platform, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to prohibit certain Digital Asset Wallet&#x27;s from connecting to the Platform or from interacting with any part of the Services.\n2.1.  Non-Custodial\nThe Services are non-custodial applications; we do not, at any time, custody, possess, or control the virtual currency, cryptocurrency, stablecoins, or other cryptographic tokens (collectively, &quot;Digital Assets&quot;) in your Digital Asset Wallet. As the owner of the Digital Assets stored by the Digital Asset Wallet, you acknowledge and agree that you bear all risk of loss regarding such Digital Assets and you will not hold us liable for Digital Asset fluctuations or other loss associated with any Digital Asset Wallet you use in connection with the Services. \n2.2.  Security\nYou are solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys associated with any Digital Asset Wallet you use or connect to the Services. You should never share your Digital Asset Wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. We accept no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a Digital Asset Wallet. We make no representations or warranties regarding how any of the Services will interact or operate with any specific Digital Asset Wallet. \n3.  THE PLATFORM\nThe Platform provides a web or mobile-based means to access software protocols that run on blockchain networks (collectively, the &quot;Protocol&quot;). The Protocol enables users to perform transactions with Digital Assets compatible with the underlying blockchain network. The Platform is distinct from the Protocol. The Platform is one but not the exclusive means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol itself is comprised of open-source or source-available self-executing smart contracts.\nYou acknowledge and agree that we do not control the Protocol and do not have control over Digital Asset transactions conducted on the Protocol. You also acknowledge and agree that that your interactions and/or transactions, including Digital Asset transactions, are not transactions with us. You further understand and agree that we do not own, operate, or control the Protocol&#x27;s liquidity pools and do not control trade execution on the Protocol. \n4.  THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND WAIVER\nThe Services may include, without limitation, links to sites, technology, applications, products, services, materials, or resources, provided or made available by a third party (collectively, &quot;Third Party Services&quot;). Your access and/or use of a Third Party Service is subject to the terms and policies of the applicable provider of the Third Party Service. We do not control any Third Party Service. \n4.1.  Third Party Services\nYou acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for all costs and charges associated with your use of a Third Party Service. Our integration or inclusion of a Third Party Service does not imply endorsement or recommendation. You also acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability, reliability, accuracy, or legitimacy of any Third Party Service (including any related websites, resources or links displayed therein). Any dispute you have with a Third Party Service provider including, without limitation, your intellectual property rights, is between you and the applicable provider of the Third Party Service. We will not be responsible or liable for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by, or in connection with, your use of, or reliance on, a Third Party Service.\nIf, to the extent we permit, you permit a third party or Third Party Service to access or connect to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that granting permission to any third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under these Terms. You are fully responsible for any act or omission of any third party. You acknowledge and agree that you will not hold us responsible for, and will indemnify us from, any and all liability arising out of or related to any third party&#x27;s act or omission with access to your Digital Asset Wallet, application, software, or other mechanism that you use to interact with the Services.\n4.2.  Waiver of Claims\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you waive any and all claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, against us and our affiliates, and each of our respective officers, employees, agents, and successors arising out of or in any way related to any of the risks set forth herein. You also waive application of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, or any similar stature or law of any other jurisdiction. Section 1542 reads as follows: &quot;a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.&quot; \n5.  REWARDS\nWe may provide certain incentives, prizes, or rewards for completing certain activities (&quot;Rewards&quot;). We reserve the right to change, modify, discontinue, or cancel any Reward at any time and without notice to you. You understand and agree that we do not guarantee that you will receive a Reward or other incentive. Any information regarding the potential amount of a Reword is an estimate only. We expressly disclaim all representations and warranties regarding any Reward including, without limitation: (a) any stated percentage of a Reward that will be received; (b) any Reward will occur on a continuous basis; (c) that Rewards will be on an uninterrupted basis or error-free basis; and/or (d) any particular Digital Asset will be available in connection with the Reward. Any Reward we make available from time to time is subject to these Terms and any other applicable term or provision regarding such Reward. Some or all of your Rewards may be programmatically destroyed as a penalty imposed by the applicable underlying blockchain network (&quot;Slashing Penalty&quot;). Foil will not be responsible or liable for any loss or penalty of a Reward or Slashing Penalty.\n6.  RISK DISCLOSURES\nYou understand, accept, and agree to assume all of the various risks involved in using the Services and holding, transacting, and transferring Digital Assets including all of the risks set forth below.\n\nDigital Assets, the features, functions, characteristics, operations, use, and other properties and/or software, networks, protocols, systems, or other technology that Digital Assets interact with is complex; and Digital Asset terms, features, or risks may not be readily or fully understood due to such complexities. \nIf you act as a liquidity provider through the Services, you understand that your Digital Asset may lose some or all value while supplied to the Protocol due to fluctuations in Digital Asset prices in a trading pair or liquidity pool. \nStaking rewards are not guaranteed and may be based on network performance, validator reliability, and other external factors. Foil does not assure any specific level of returns or profitability from staking activities. \nIf you supply Digital Asset to a liquidity pool in an automated market maker (&quot;AMM&quot;), your deposited assets may lose relative value as the ratio of the Digital Assets in the liquidity pool fluctuate (&quot;Impermanent Loss&quot;). An AMM functions by allowing market forces to rebalance the ratio of Digital Assets in a liquidity pool. Once this rebalancing or Digital Assets occurs, you may end up withdrawing a different ratio of Digital Assets than when you deposited your Digital Assets into the liquidity pool. As such, you may perceive a &quot;loss&quot; in value in U.S. dollar terms due to the rebalancing of the Digital Assets in the liquidity pool. You represent that you understand the risk of Impermanent Loss. You further represent that you have carefully considered the likelihood of price divergence in a liquidity pool, and that you understand that we cannot control the amount of loss that you incur.\nYou understand that we do not create, own, or operate cross-chain bridges and we do not make any representation or warranty about the safety or soundness of any cross chain bridge.\nDigital Assets will be irretrievably lost if sent to the wrong address. For instance, if the address is improperly formatted, contains an error, or for a different type of Digital Asset. \nDigital Assets may be subject to forks or attacks on the security, integrity, and/or operation of the networks, including any network events. These events may affect features, functionality, operations, use, or properties of any Digital Asset or network and/or the value of any Digital Asset.\nThe value of certain Digital Assets like non-fungible tokens (&quot;NFTs&quot;) is subjective. The price of a NFTs is subject to volatility and fluctuations in the price of other Digital Assets.\nCollateral for decentralized finance protocols and projects may be higher than similar centralized protocols and projects.\nAny Digital Asset and/or the Services may be targeted by malicious persons or individuals who may attempt to disrupt the Services or steal Digital Assets. This includes but is not limited to malware, hacking, phishing, double spending, smurfing, spoofing, sybil attacks, social engineering, majority mining, mining attacks, distributed denial of service, and blockchain forks.\nThe public nature of the Internet means that parts or the Internet may be unreliable or unavailable at any given time. Interruption, delay, corruption, loss of data, the loss of confidentiality or privacy through the course of data transmission, or malware transmission may occur when transmitting data via the Internet or other technology. This can result in your transaction(s) not being executed according to your instructions, at the requested time, and/or not at all. No technology is completely secure or safe.\nDigital Assets may decrease in value or lose all value, in a short period of time or permanently, due to various factors including, without limitation, government or regulatory activity, the discovery of wrongful or illegal conduct, market manipulation, price distortion, insider dealing, market distortion, malicious wrongdoing or behaviors, changes to the Digital Asset&#x27;s nature or characteristics, suspension, or cessation of support for a Digital Asset by exchanges, public opinion, technical advancements, macroeconomic and political factors, and other factors outside of our control\nDigital Assets held by a decentralized application and Digital Asset Wallets are not protected deposits and may not be protected by any deposit protection scheme. Thus, Digital Assets have a reduced level and type of protection compared to fiat and other asset classes or types.\nThe creation of the Protocol may be abandoned for reasons including without limitation, lack of interest, funding, incapacitation of key developers or project members, lack of commercial success or prospects, or Force Majeure Event (defined below). You understand that there are no assurances regarding any benefit to interacting with the Services, even if the project and/or the Protocol was partially or fully developed and launched.\nThe Services may undergo significant changes over time. We may also limit control over how other visitors and/or users can use the Services and what services are offered on or through the Platform. This could create the risk of the Services not meeting your expectations, for any number of reasons, including mistaken assumptions or analysis, a change in the design and/or implementation plans, or execution on or through the Services. \nWe currently rely on our service providers for certain aspects of our operations including cloud computing services and data centers that provide facilities, infrastructure, website functionality and access, components, and services, all of which are critical to our operations. Like most other online companies, because we rely on service providers, we face operational risk. Any interruption in the services provided by our service providers can impair our ability to provide the Services.\nWe do not directly manage the operation of the service providers we use including their data center facilities. Such third parties are vulnerable to financial, legal, regulatory, and labor issues, cybersecurity incidents, break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, privacy breaches, service terminations, disruptions, interruptions, Force Majeure Events, and other events. \nDigital Asset transactions rely on smart contracts stored on various blockchains, cryptographic tokens generated by smart contracts, and other nascent software, applications and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. These technologies are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and subject to change. A defining feature of blockchain technology is that its entries are immutable, which means, as a technical matter, they generally cannot be deleted or modified by anyone. You acknowledge and understand that smart contracts dictate how funds and ownership of Digital Assets are distributed.\nYou acknowledge and understand that you may be subject to scams and/or other types of fraud perpetrated by parties outside of our control. It is your responsibility to be aware of and protect against such misconduct. In the event that you are subject to such fraud, there is a risk of loss of your Digital Assets.\nAll blockchain transactions include data and, in some circumstances, personal data about you. Many blockchain technologies store transaction data publicly and permanently. When you use such public blockchain technology, you intentionally make your transaction data public and acknowledge that this data cannot be deleted, removed, or reversed due to the nature of blockchain technology.\nWe are subject to an extensive and rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, and any changes to any law or regulation could adversely impact our ability to offer the Services and/or your use or access to the Services. Such regulatory change may also impact your legal obligations with respect to your use of the Services.\nYou understand that smart contract transactions automatically execute and settle, and blockchain-based transactions are irreversible when confirmed. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk of selecting your slippage rate which expose you to additional cost or fees by the underlying blockchain network.\n\n7.

Waiver of Class Actions and Right to Jury Trial\nTo the extent permissible by law, any claim, controversy, or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, or any products or services provided in connection with the Services (each a &quot;Dispute&quot;) must be brought in your individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any putative class, collective action, or representative proceeding (collectively &quot;Class Action Waiver&quot;). The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#x27;s claims or engage in any arbitration on behalf of a class. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you are waiving the right to a trial by jury and the right to participate in a class action.\n21.2.  Informal  Resolution \nBefore filing a claim against Foil, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute by first emailing oxideinc@proton.me with a description of your claim and proof of your relationship with Foil. If we can&#x27;t resolve the Dispute within sixty days of our receipt of your first email, you or Foil may then submit the Dispute to binding arbitration as provided herein.\n21.3. Arbitration Agreement\nAll Disputes between you and Foil must be resolved by final and binding arbitration. By agreeing to binding arbitration, you and Foil expressly waive the right to formal court proceedings including without limitation trial by jury and class action.

(&quot;FAA&quot;).\n21.4. Conducting Arbitration\nThe arbitration shall be conducted by the International Chamber of Commerce (&quot;ICC&quot;) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (&quot;ICC Rules&quot;) then in effect. If you are a consumer, the most recent version of the ICC Rules can be accessed here. These Terms shall govern any conflict between the ICC Rules and these Terms. The location and type of hearing shall be determined in accordance with the ICC Rules. Further, a party&#x27;s right to request a hearing shall also be determined in accordance with the ICC Rules. Unless otherwise ordered by an arbitrator or pursuant to the ICC Rules, any in-person arbitration shall be in English and held remotely to the maximum extent and administered in the Republic of Panama or another mutually agreeable location. \n21.5. Confidentiality\nFoil, the arbitrator, and you, will each maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments, and awards including information shared and produced during the arbitration.\n21.6. Arbitration Time for Filing\nAny arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim. If applicable law prohibits a one year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. If a claim is not filed within such period, the Dispute is permanently barred.\n21.7.  Severability\nIf any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms and such severance of the provision(s) shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section. Further, to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Lastly, if any provision in this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, such provision shall have no effect to the extent relief is allowed to be sought outside of arbitration. The remainder of this section shall remain in full force and effect.\n21.8.  Modification\nNotwithstanding any term or provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and Foil agree that if Foil makes any future material change to this section, we will notify you.

GOVERNING LAW\nThis Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the Republic of Panama without regard to conflict of law rules or principles that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that Foil may initiate a proceeding relating to the enforceability or validity of Foil&#x27;s intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. With respect to any other proceeding not subject to arbitration under this Agreement, the courts of the Republic of Panama will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue in any such courts. \n23.
